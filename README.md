Stock Market Prediction Project
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project repository! As a data scientist, I embarked on a journey to analyze and predict stock market trends using a comprehensive dataset encompassing crucial variables such as date, opening price, high price, low price, and closing price of stocks.

Project Overview
In this project, the primary objectives were to:

Analyze Historical Data: Dive into the stock market dataset to understand historical trends and patterns.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
Model Development: Employ state-of-the-art data science tools, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, to build a robust predictive model.
Visualization: Leverage matplotlib, chart_studio, and plotly for insightful visualizations to aid in data interpretation.
Why Stock Market Prediction?
Understanding and predicting stock market movements is a critical aspect of financial decision-making. By harnessing the power of data science, this project aims to provide valuable insights into market behavior, helping investors and businesses make informed decisions.
